        <h2>Why your LinkedIn background matters</h2>
        <p>
          A great LinkedIn photo does not need an expensive camera, but it should be bright, sharp, and distraction‑free.
          Busy office walls, people walking behind you, or messy rooms can make the picture look less professional. [web:358][web:362]
        </p>
        <p>
          Removing the background helps keep the focus on your face and makes your profile look more intentional and trustworthy.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 1 – Choose a good starting photo</h2>
        <p>
          Pick a photo where:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your face is clearly visible and well lit.</li>
          <li>You are the only main subject (no cropped friends or colleagues).</li>
          <li>The image is not too dark or heavily filtered.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 2 – Remove the background</h2>
        <p>
          Open <a href="/">ImageBackgroundRemover</a> and upload your chosen portrait. The tool automatically detects you and erases
          the background in a couple of seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check the edges around your hair and shoulders. If something looks off, try another photo where the background
          is simpler and there is more contrast between you and the wall.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 3 – Download and add a clean background</h2>
        <p>
          Download the result as a transparent PNG using the <strong>Download PNG</strong> button. This lets you place yourself on
          any background without re‑editing the cut‑out each time. [web:359][web:368]
        </p>
        <p>
          You can then:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Place the PNG on a plain light gray, blue, or brand color background.</li>
          <li>Add a subtle gradient to make the image feel modern but still professional.</li>
          <li>Keep it simple so your face stays the main focus.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 4 – Upload the new picture to LinkedIn</h2>
        <p>
          In LinkedIn, open your profile, click your profile photo, and upload the new image. Adjust the crop so your head
          and shoulders fill most of the circle. [web:360]
        </p>
        <p>
          After saving, check how the photo looks on desktop and on mobile to make sure nothing important is cut off.
        </p>

        <h2>Extra tips for a strong profile photo</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Wear something that fits your industry (for example, more formal for finance, more relaxed for creative roles).</li>
          <li>Use natural light from a window rather than strong overhead lighting.</li>
          <li>Aim for a friendly, relaxed expression instead of a serious passport‑style pose.</li>
          <li>Keep filters gentle; a natural look usually performs best with recruiters. [web:358][web:362]</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Make background cleanup part of your personal brand</h2>
        <p>
          Whenever you update your CV, portfolio, or social profiles, you can reuse the same clean portrait from
          <a href="/">ImageBackgroundRemover</a>. This gives you a consistent, polished look everywhere online.
        </p>
        <p>
          Save the tool so you can quickly refresh your photo the next time you change your hairstyle, get a new job,
          or simply want a better first impression.
