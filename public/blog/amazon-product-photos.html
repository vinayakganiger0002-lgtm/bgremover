        <h2>Why background removal matters for Amazon</h2>
        <p>
          Amazon recommends product photos with a plain white background so the item is the only thing buyers see, 
          without props or distracting colors around it. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Listings with clean, bright images usually get higher click‑through rates in search results, which can lead 
          to more impressions and more chances to sell. 
        </p>

        <h2>What you need before you start</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Your product photo in good lighting (phone camera is fine if the image is sharp).</li>
          <li>Access to <a href="/">ImageBackgroundRemover</a> in your browser.</li>
          <li>A few minutes to upload, remove the background, and download a PNG with transparent or white background.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 1 – Upload your product image</h2>
        <p>
          Go to <a href="/">ImageBackgroundRemover</a> and click <strong>Upload Image</strong>, or drag and drop a file into the upload area. 
          You can use JPG, PNG, JPEG, or WEBP up to the allowed size limit.
        </p>
        <p>
          As soon as the image is uploaded, you will see the original on the left and a “Removing background…” 
          message while the AI processes your photo.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 2 – Let the AI remove the background</h2>
        <p>
          The tool automatically detects the product and removes everything else around it, giving you a clean transparent background. 
          This is much faster than manually cutting out the product in an editor. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Check edges like hair, cables, or small details. If something important is missing, try again with a photo where the product 
          is clearly separated from the background.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 3 – Download a PNG for Amazon</h2>
        <p>
          When you like the result, click <strong>Download PNG</strong>. The file you get has a transparent background, 
          which is perfect if you want to place it on a pure white background later. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For most Amazon listings, a white or very light background works best, because it blends with the Amazon search results page 
          and keeps attention on the product. 
        </p>

        <h2>Step 4 – Upload to your Amazon listing</h2>
        <p>
          In Seller Central, open your product listing, go to the <strong>Images</strong> section, and upload the new background‑free photo 
          as your main image.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure the product fills most of the frame, is centered, and looks sharp at full size so buyers can zoom in on details. [web:340]
        </p>

        <h2>Tips for getting the best results</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Use even, soft lighting to avoid harsh shadows behind the product.</li>
          <li>Shoot against a simple wall or sheet so the AI can separate the product more easily. [web:336]</li>
          <li>Take photos at a slightly higher resolution than you need so they stay crisp after cropping.</li>
          <li>Keep a consistent angle and distance for all products in the same category to look professional on your store page.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Use ImageBackgroundRemover for your whole catalog</h2>
        <p>
          Once you have a workflow that works for one product, repeat it for your whole Amazon catalog so all of your listings share 
          the same clean, professional look.
