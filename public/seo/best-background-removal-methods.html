            <h1>Best Background Removal Methods: Complete Guide to Professional Image Editing</h1>
            
            <p>Removing backgrounds from images is a fundamental skill in digital image editing. Whether you're preparing product photos, creating marketing materials, or working on personal projects, choosing the right background removal method can make the difference between hours of work and seconds of processing.</p>

            <h2>Overview of Background Removal Methods</h2>
            <p>There are several approaches to removing backgrounds, each with its own advantages and use cases. Understanding these methods helps you choose the best approach for your specific needs.</p>

            <h2>1. AI-Powered Automated Tools</h2>
